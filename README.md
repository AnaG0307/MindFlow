## **Introduction**

#### **Project Title:**

MindFlow

#### **Developers:**

Ana Genover, Edita Dolnickova, Adonelle Sagoe, Imane Zioche, Morag McClenaghan

#### **Aims & Objectives of the project:**

To create a mood-tracking app for women to track how they feel throughout their menstrual cycles as well as any physical symptoms.

A recent [survey by the UK government](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/womens-health-strategy-call-for-evidence/outcome/results-of-the-womens-health-lets-talk-about-it-survey) found that 84% of women in the UK felt that there are times when healthcare professionals have not listened to their health concerns. Furthermore only 17% of women felt like they had access to enough information on menstrual wellbeing, and only 8% felt they had access to adequate information about gynaecological conditions.

#### **Roadmap of the report:**

## **Background**

#### **Specifics of the project:**

Our web application has been designed for women to track their mood (and symptoms?\*) to both gain a personal insight into their condition and to have clear and concise information to show their GP’s should they seek medical assistance.

It can often be challenging to be taken seriously as a woman when it comes to healthcare, particularly when it comes to women’s health. We hope that our application will help women to gain a better understanding of both their health and mental wellbeing, and possibly be a platform from which they can begin to seek treatment, should they require it.

#### **Key Features:**

- Cycle tracker
- Calendar overview
- Mood insight stats
- Symptom tracker/stats?
- Daily questionnaire
- Daily reminder
- User profile

#### **Target Demographic:**

Women and those who experience menstruation of all ages.

## **Implementation and Execution**

#### **Team Approach to Work:**

Using the Agile methodology we had a retrospective and review meeting once a week. We also met for stand-ups where possible, and ensure that we plan out our objectives for each of our week-long sprints. We did set a rough meeting schedule of Monday, Wednesday and Friday, although this was flexible to accommodate everyone’s individual schedules. We each updated our Google doc daily with what we have done that day. We initially planned to test our code after the second week and test our code as we go along. Feedback from the testing was provided in our meetings.

We were working in a shared GitHub repository, checking out branches and taking care when merging with the main branch. As none of us are that experienced using GitHub we initially created a practice repository to practice uploading code, checking out branches and merging. Once we felt confident with GitHub we started for real!

#### **Team Members Roles:**

- Front-end: Adonelle and Morag
- Back-end: Ana and Edita
- Connecting front-end and back-end: Imane - tester

We have tried and distribute the workload as evenly as possible, however if one area takes more time/is more labour intensive than others then our team-mates steped in to help as required.

#### **Communication Tools:**

- Slack: for daily communication.
- Google Docs: to keep track of our meetings and centralise the information we gather about the topics we work on.
- Discord: for our meetings.
- Jira (free edition): to create a board with all of our tasks and keep track of what we are doing and what the other members are doing.

#### **Tools & Libraries:**

- Github
- React
- Miro
- CSS Helper
- Node.js/ Express
- Lucid Chart
- Graphic Assets (Canva)
- MongoDB
- NPM Calendat
- NPM Moment

## **Getting Started**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
